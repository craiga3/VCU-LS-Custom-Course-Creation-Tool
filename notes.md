## Development Notes

- [x] Use enrollment API to verify non-student using course roles

- [x] On Auth, do enrollments check and return authorized or not

- [] For each category of course you can create, have checkboxes which make the user read and agree to the conditions of each type of course and course retention details, etc before being able to name the course.
