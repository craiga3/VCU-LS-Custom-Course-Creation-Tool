### A. Creating a Sandbox Course Shell

Sandboxes are excellent for experimenting with Canvas features without impacting live courses.

**Sandbox Course Guidelines:**
*   Intended for individual testing and development.
*   **Not** for student enrollment or official training.
*   Limited to **one** Sandbox course per user. If you already have one, you'll be given options to manage it.
*   Will be named: `Sandbox - [Your Chosen Name]`

**Creation Process:**

1.  **Read Guidelines & Agree:**
    *   After selecting "Sandbox Course Shell," review the guidelines presented.
    *   To proceed, type **"I agree"** (case-insensitive) into the text box.
    *   The "Next" button will become active once you type "I agree" AND the tool has checked if you have an existing sandbox (this check happens automatically).
    ![Agree Input Example](https://via.placeholder.com/300x50.png?text=I+agree+input) <!-- Placeholder -->

2.  **Managing Existing Sandbox (if applicable):**
    *   If the tool detects you already have a Sandbox course, you will be taken to the "Sandbox Course Management" page.
    *   Here, you can choose to:
        *   **Reset:** Clears all content from your existing Sandbox course but keeps the shell. This is useful if you want to start fresh.
        *   **Delete:** Permanently deletes your existing Sandbox course. This allows you to create a new one if you wish.
        ![Sandbox Management Example](https://via.placeholder.com/400x150.png?text=Sandbox+Management+Table) <!-- Placeholder -->
    *   For either action (Reset or Delete), you will be asked to **Confirm**.
    *   If you delete all your existing sandboxes, you'll be redirected to create a new one.
    *   If you wish to proceed with your existing sandbox or have reset/deleted one and want to create a new one, you might be taken back to the "I agree" step or directly to naming. Follow the on-screen buttons.
    *   You can also navigate **"Back to Sandbox Setup"** (the "I agree" page) or **"Back to Course Type Selection"**.

3.  **Name Your Sandbox Course:**
    *   If you are creating a new Sandbox (either because you didn't have one or you deleted an old one), you'll be prompted to give your course a name.
    *   **Course Name:** Enter a descriptive name for your sandbox (e.g., "Exploring New Quizzes," "Accessibility Testing").
    *   A preview of the full course name (`Sandbox - [Your Chosen Name]`) will be displayed.
    *   Click **"Next"**.
    ![Sandbox Naming Example](https://via.placeholder.com/350x100.png?text=Sandbox+Name+Input) <!-- Placeholder -->

4.  **Confirmation:**
    *   Review the Course Type ("Sandbox") and the Final Course Name.
    *   If correct, click **"Submit Request"**.
    *   If you need to make changes, click **"Previous"**.

5.  **Course Created:**
    *   You will see a success message with the name, ID, and a direct link to your new Sandbox course in Canvas.
    *   Click the link to access your course.
    *   You can then choose to **"Create Another Course / Start Over"**.

### C. Creating a Primary Course Template Shell

Primary Course Templates are for faculty who wish to maintain a master version of their course content separate from live, taught courses. This is useful for ongoing development and as a backup.

**Primary Course Template Guidelines:**
*   For continuous development and storage of master course materials.
*   **Not** intended for student enrollment or direct instruction.
*   Will **not** be listed in Canvas Catalog.
*   Naming convention is specific: `Primary - [SUBJ] - [CourseNum] - [Your Course Name/Description] - [Your eID] - [MM/YY]` (e.g., Primary - BIOL - 101 - Intro to Biology - jdoe - 03/24).

**Creation Process:**

    *   After selecting "Primary Course Template Shell," review the guidelines.
    *   Type **"I agree"** (case-insensitive) into the text box to activate the "Next" button.

2.  **Configure Your Primary Course Template:**
    You will need to provide several pieces of information:
    *   **Subject:** The 4-letter subject code (e.g., ENGL, MATH, BIOL). Max 4 letters.
    *   **Course Number:** The course number (e.g., 101, 202). Max 3 alphanumeric characters.
    *   **Descriptive Course Name:** A brief, descriptive name for your template (e.g., "Introduction to Psychology," "Organic Chemistry Lab Materials").
    *   Your VCU eID and the current Month/Year (MM/YY) will be automatically appended based on your login and the current date.
    *   A preview of the full, formatted course name will be displayed as you type. Ensure all fields are filled to activate the "Next" button.
    ![Primary Template Naming Example](https://via.placeholder.com/400x200.png?text=Primary+Template+Fields) <!-- Placeholder -->
    *   Click **"Next"**.

3.  **Confirmation:**

## Important Considerations

*   **VCU Records Management:** You are responsible for maintaining all records as required by [VCU Records Management](https://go.vcu.edu/records-management) and any superseding precedent.
*   **Records Ownership:** More information on [records ownership can be found here](https://go.vcu.edu/records-ownership).
*   **Canvas Data Retention:** Specific policies for [Canvas data retention are available here](https://learningsystems.vcu.edu/guidelines--procedures/records-management-policy--canvas-usage-at-vcu/).
*   **Data Storage:** For guidance on where to store different types of data within VCU systems, consult the [VCU Data Management System](https://dms.vcu.edu).
*   **Audits:** Non-academic course shells are subject to periodic audit by VCU.
*   **Misuse:** Using a non-academic shell for purposes against the provided guidelines and restrictions may result in suspension of access or removal of the course.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

*   **"Access Denied" or "Not authorized: No verification role found."**
    *   This usually means you do not have a current or past Teacher (or equivalent) role in any VCU Canvas course, or there was an issue verifying your role.
    *   Ensure you are logged into Canvas with your correct VCU eID.
    *   If you believe this is an error, please contact VCU Learning Systems by emailing [LSRequest@vcu.edu](mailto:LSREQUEST@vcu.edu?subject=Canvas%20Non-Academic%20Course%20Creation%20Tool%20Access%20Request) with the subject line "Canvas Non-Academic Course Creation Tool Access Request."

*   **Error Message Displayed (Red Bar at Top or Other Errors):**
    *   If you see an error message (often in a red bar or replacing the main content), read it carefully. It may provide specific reasons for the failure (e.g., "Error creating course: Name too long," or a server error).
    *   Try the action again. Sometimes, temporary network issues can cause problems.
    *   If the error persists, note down the exact error message and contact support.

*   **Buttons Not Working / Page Seems Stuck:**
    *   Ensure you have completed all required fields (e.g., typing "I agree," filling in all name parts for Primary Templates).
    *   Check your internet connection.
    *   Try refreshing the page. You may need to log in again.
    *   If the "Logout" button is disabled, it means an API call is in progress. Please wait a few moments. If it remains disabled for an extended period, try refreshing.
